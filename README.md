Metropolis-Hastings Neural Network

This is an implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for creating a softmax classifier.
It's performance and convergence rates depend highly on the initial paramters.
I wouldn't use it for a competition, but is a useful demonstration of the uses of
Monte-Carlo methods for model optimisation.
